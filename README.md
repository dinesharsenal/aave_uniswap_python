Hi there!

In this project i have used python to interact with the defi protocols Aave and Uniswap:

Brief oveview of the steps followed in the code:

1) Swap eth for weth
2) Deposit some ETH(WETH) into AAVE
3) Buy some asset using the ETH colateral
   3.1. Sell that borrowed asset (Short Selling)
4) Repay everything back
